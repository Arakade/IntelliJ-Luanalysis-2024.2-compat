    An IDE for statically typed Lua development.<br>

    <change-notes><![CDATA[
    <strong>1.2.1</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved return inspection handling for unions of multiple results</li>
        <li>Improved stdlib string module definitions</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>1.2.0</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Requires IntelliJ IDEA 203 (2020.3)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Breaking:</strong> Removed unsafe assumed constructor functionality (<a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/IntelliJ-Luanalysis/issues/12">#12</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Lua 5.4 support:</strong> &lt;const&gt; and &lt;close&gt; local variables and corresponding immutability inspections.</li>
        <li>Removed 'Recognize global name as type' plugin option as its use encourages unsafe development practices.</li>
        <li>Added new setting "Unknown type (any) is callable" which is enabled by default. For stricter type safety it's suggested you disable this option.</li>
        <li>Added an "Illegal inheritance" inspection which will report inheritance cycles and inheritance from primitives.</li>
        <li>Substantially improved (more refined) problem annotations on deeply nested table literals (<a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/IntelliJ-Luanalysis/issues/11">#11</a> and more.)</li>
        <li>Ensured inspections are re-run in more situations when variable types or type definitions are modified.</li>
        <li>Improved lookup performance for locally scoped types, currently just generic types.</li>
        <li>Performance improvements when dealing with types defined in the non-working file.</li>
        <li>Jump to definition behavior for fields that are members of a table, table&ltK, V&gt; or V[].</li>
        <li>Added proper descriptions for every Luanalysis inspection.</li>
        <li>Improved mouse-over pop-up docs for table literals that will be interpreted as a shape.</li>
        <li>Only a subset of inspections are now run against files with the extension <strong>.def.lua</strong> e.g. return statement inspections are not run against functions</li>
        <li>Improved inspections for missing arguments and colon/period function calls e.g. "Missing self argument. Did you mean to call the method with a colon?"</li>
        <li>Corrected stdlib definitions for string.find()</li>
        <li>Corrected stdlib definitions for next, ipairs and pairs.</li>
        <li>Improved type safety of stdlib io module methods.</li>
        <li>Improved stdlib math.random() definition. Contributed by <a href="https://github.com/omniraptorr">Omniraptor</a></li>
        <li>Improved stdlib string.gsub() definition. Contributed by <a href="https://github.com/omniraptorr">Omniraptor</a></li>
        <li>Fixed several related bugs that could cause Luanalysis to get into a state where it was unable to recognise both user and in-built types.</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where shape inspections were appearing on table literals subject to a type cast (<a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/IntelliJ-Luanalysis/issues/14">#14</a>)</li>
        <li>Static analysis now correctly handles use of parentheses to restrict multiple return values to just the first value.</li>
        <li>Fixed handling of iterators.</li>
        <li>Improved formatting/consistency of complex types displayed in the UI.</li>
        <li><em>function</em> type is now treated as returning <em>any...</em></li>
        <li>Fixed use of <em>@overload</em> in <em>@class</em> definitions that do not proceed a variable declaration/assignment.</li>
        <li>Smarter union behavior that eliminates duplicate/covariant types from the union. This tends to result in much simple error message.</li>
        <li>Fixed handling of some situations where table literals ought to be interpreted as arrays, but were not.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>1.1.0</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Ctrl/Cmd + Click ("Go To") on a string literal argument of a require("file") now takes you to the return value of the referenced file, rather than simply opening the file.<li>
        <li>Fixed type resolution of require("file") expressions, where the referenced file has no return statements.</li>
        <li>Added/fixed support for negative number literal types.</li>
        <li>Type inference will now handle unary minus (negate) expressions, where the operand is a number literal. String literals representing values that Lua will <em>silently coerce</em> to a number are also handled.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>1.0.3</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensured "Return type 'void' specified but no return values found" annotation is no longer raised for functions annotated as ---@return void.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>1.0.2</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Same as 1.0.1, but not constrained to IntelliJ 201 (2020.1).</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>1.0.1</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Replaced duplicate class inspection with duplicate type inspection. Class/alias name collisions are now reported.</li>
        <li>Despite the Lua manual indicating otherwise, bit32 is present in Lua 5.3, added it.</li>
        <li>Ensured arrays are not covariant of shapes representing tuples.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>1.0.0</strong>
    Initial release
    <ul>
        <li>Derived from EmmyLua 1.3.3</li>
        <li>A heap of static analysis improvements over EmmyLua 1.3.3</li>
    </ul>
